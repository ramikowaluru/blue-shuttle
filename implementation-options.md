## Final Recommendation

**For Your Club:**
Given you have 10-12 players paying £10-12 per week (£120 total), spending more than £20/month on a platform doesn't make sense.

**Start with:**
- Google Forms + Sheets (FREE)
- Test for 1 month
- If successful, add Calendly (£10/month)
- This saves Maz hours while costing less than one player's weekly fee

**Avoid:**
- Payment processing (fees too high for small amounts)
- Complex systems (you only play Fridays)
- Expensive platforms (eat into club funds)
